<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Mozammil Tarique, I have been a commerce student all thourgh out my life. But after completing me graduation I have decided to change me stream and shift towards Web Development and Software Courses. As a child I have always been indulged with computers.
  So I have desided to now become a MERN web developer. I have purchased a course from Udemy to learn the MERN full-stack.
